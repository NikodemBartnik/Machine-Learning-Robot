I recommend using the **main.ipynb** file (Jupyter Notebook Python file) as the code is nicely explained and divided. Alternatively, there is also a traditional **main.py** file available. The folder "old" contains older files that were the results of experiments with different classifiers and visualizations.

If you are unfamiliar with Jupyter Notebook and how to use it, especially with tools like VS Code, you can find guidance [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/datascience/jupyter-notebooks).

This code was employed for data processing, where all the machine learning tasks take place. After cleaning the data, selecting the most important dimensions, and training the classifier, you export the classifier as a header file. Remember to move it to the Arduino folder, and the file should start with **Classifier_***.
